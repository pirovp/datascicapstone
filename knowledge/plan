exploratory analysis:
      Tasks to accomplish

Exploratory analysis - perform a thorough exploratory analysis of the data, understanding the distribution of words and relationship between the words in the corpora.
Understand frequencies of words and word pairs - build figures and tables to understand variation in the frequencies of words and word pairs in the data.
Questions to consider

Some words are more frequent than others - what are the distributions of word frequencies?
What are the frequencies of 2-grams and 3-grams in the dataset?
How many unique words do you need in a frequency sorted dictionary to cover 50% of all word instances in the language? 90%?
How do you evaluate how many of the words come from foreign languages?
Can you think of a way to increase the coverage -- identifying words that may not be in the corpora or using a smaller number of words in the dictionary to cover the same number of phrases?
